## What did I do last week?

Last week, I started by diving into the foundational aspects of product management frameworks. I focused on understanding the key principles of Agile, Lean, and Waterfall methodologies. I also began experimenting with Jira, Trello, and Asana to get a feel for how these tools function in a real-world setting.

## do I plan to do this week?

This week, my goal is to narrow down my focus based on the initial exploration. I plan to:

1. Deepen my research into the Agile framework, as it seems most relevant to my upcoming role.

2. Continue hands-on practice with Jira, aiming to complete a few mock projects to better understand its capabilities.

3. Reach out to experienced product managers for interviews to gather insights on effective stakeholder management.

4. Start documenting my findings and creating a structured guide on the best practices for using product management tools.

5. Get my GitHub website running.

## Are there any impediments in your way?

Balancing my new job responsibilities with this project can be challenging. Also, ensuring that I adhere to my companyâ€™s policies regarding the use of work-related materials for this course is something I need to be cautious about.

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

Reflecting on last week, I realized that while exploring multiple frameworks and tools was informative, it also spread my focus thin. To improve, I plan to concentrate on one framework at a time, starting with Agile, and master it before moving on to others. Additionally, setting specific, achievable goals for each week will help in maintaining a steady pace and ensure that I stay on track.
