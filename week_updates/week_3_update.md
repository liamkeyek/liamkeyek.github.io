## What did you do last week?

Last week I got my GitHub running for this class. I spoke with one of my mentors about this project and he suggested a different approach to learning PM skills. I have narrowed my focus to a LinkedIn Learning course, reading Managing Product Success by Edison Tse, and reading Lenny's Newsletter on Substack. I am now more confident about my approach to this course after testing my ideas with a PM who has industry experience at Google and Stripe (also a former CU CS PhD!).

## What do you plan to do this week?

I completed my project proposal and am looking forward to feedback. You can view it on my GitHub. With the remainder of the week I am going to start working on the LinkedIn learning, reading the textbook, and reading the Substack. 


## Are there any impediments in your way?

Nope! 

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

Last week was about me getting oriented with my approach. I realized I was doing too much in my last post and getting lost in the abundance of resources. I'm more confident about my path forward.
