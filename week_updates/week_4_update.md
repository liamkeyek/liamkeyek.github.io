## What did you do last week?

Last week I completed the project proposal and started my LinkedIn learning plan.

## What do you plan to do this week?

- I will read chapter 1 and 2 of the PM textbook I identified.
- I will continue to work on the LinkedIn Learning path.

## Are there any impediments in your way?

N/A

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

I decided that I will block off time on my calendar for this class as a forcing function to spend more time reading and working on the LinkedIn learning.
