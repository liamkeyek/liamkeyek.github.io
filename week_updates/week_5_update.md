## What happened last week?

Last week I completed my first chapter of my Product Management textbook. The professor was talking about zero to 1 product development versus 1 to n product development. He gave most of his examples through the context of Apple launching the Apple I and II back in the 80s - 90s.

## What do I plan to do this week? 

This week I plan to complete the next chapter and start thinking about a blog post. I will also continue working on my LinkedIn Learning path. I need to spend time working the GitHub website, but I will not be able to get to this until Friday or Saturday.


## Are there any temporary roadblocks?

I am sick and traveling for work.


## How can I make the process work better? 

This week I need to allocate more time to understanding how to set up the website.
