Hey Professor Knox,
I apologize for the delay in posting. I've been traveling for work this week and just returned to Colorado.

## What happened last week?

Last week, I made significant progress by completing Chapter 2 of my chosen product management textbook. I also continued working on my LinkedIn Learning course, advancing my understanding of key PM concepts.

## What do I plan to do this week? 

- Begin and progress through Chapters 3 and 4 of the textbook.
- Focus on completing my LinkedIn Learning course, as I'm nearing the finish line.
- Start brainstorming ideas for my upcoming blog post.
- Dedicate time to working on my GitHub website, aiming to make substantial progress by the weekend.


## Are there any temporary roadblocks?

While work-related travel has been a challenge, I'm now back and ready to refocus on my studies. However, I'm currently dealing with illness, which may slightly impact my productivity.

## How can I make the process work better? 

I'll maintain my strategy of blocking off dedicated time on my calendar for coursework. Despite being under the weather, I'll try to maintain a consistent study schedule, adjusting as necessary to accommodate my health.
