## What happened last week?

Last week I completed Chapter 3 of my Managing Product Success textbook. This week, I learned about design-driven development (DDD) which emphasizes creating software products by prioritizing user experience and design aesthetics throughout the development process. This approach integrates design principles from the initial stages of product development, ensuring that the final product is not only functional but also intuitive and visually appealing.

The example in the textbook highlights how Tesla exemplifies DDD in its software products by seamlessly integrating sleek, user-friendly interfaces within their vehicles. For example, the Tesla Model S features a 17-inch touchscreen that controls nearly all aspects of the car, from navigation to climate control. The interface is designed to be intuitive, minimizing driver distraction while maximizing functionality. This design-centric approach ensures that the software enhances the overall driving experience.

## What do I plan to do this week? 

I am planning to finish Chapter 4 & 5. I also need to continue to work on my LinkedIn Learning Course.
