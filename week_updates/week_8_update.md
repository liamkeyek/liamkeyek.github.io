## What happened last week?

Last week I read chapters 4 and 5. Chapter 4 was focused on the intricacies of launching products quickly and efficiently. The main concept was the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The textbook defined the MVP as the simplest version of your product that solves a core problem. I am currently going through this process at my startup, so it was helpful to have a better framework.

Chapter 5 was focused on metrics for tracking product success. The metrics they gave were all post launch. The professor indicated tracking Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) helps measure success. CSAT measures customer satisfaction, product adoption, and growth potential. I was not aware of most of the metrics listed. This was good food for thought as my company heads into our first product launch. 

## What do I plan to do this week? 

I am planning to finish Chapter 6 and 7. Conclude my LinkedIn Learning Course. Start writing my first two blogs.
