## What happened last week?

This past week became unexpectedly busy at my new job. I did not have time to make substantial progress on Chapter 6 and 7 of my textbook. However, I did spend time working on a draft outline for my four blog posts I will write about Product Management. To increase the relevance for my fellow classmates and my team at work, I've decided to write them about the steps of 0-1 product development, a term coined by Peter Thiel in his book "Zero to One". I have not fully concluded what topics each four will be on, but I will discuss a combination of the following: 

- Value Proposition

- Design Thinking

- Problem Space and Solution Space

- Minimum Viable Product

- Product Road Map

- Agile Software Development

## What do I plan to do this week? 

I need to finish chapters 6 and 7 still. I will finalize rough drafts of my blog posts. I'm about ~30% done with the LinkedIn learning course I have been working on and will spend additional time (1-2 hours) on this. 

## Are there any temporary roadblocks?

Yes - I was in sprint planning meetings all week at work. Fortunately those are over.

## How can I make the process work better? 

I've blocked off time on my calendar to devote to this class.
